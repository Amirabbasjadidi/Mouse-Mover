# Mouse Mover Application

**I doubt this will be useful for you**, but I needed this for myself, so I made it. I figured someone else might need it too, so here it is!

This is a simple Python application that moves the mouse to a pre-defined coordinate on the screen at specific times. It can be useful for tasks like preventing your system from going to sleep by simulating mouse activity or performing automated mouse clicks at specific intervals.

## Features

- **Time-based mouse movement**: Automatically move the mouse to a specified location at given start and end times.
- **Coordinate customization**: Double-click anywhere on the screen to change the mouse movement target coordinates.
- **System tray integration**: Hide the main window and control the app from the system tray, including the options to show the app or quit.
- **Simple UI**: Easily set start and end times, and change coordinates through a graphical interface.

## Download the Executable

If you don't want to deal with Python setup and dependencies, you can download the **executable file (exe)** from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo-link/releases) section.

## Requirements

To run this program from the source code, you need the following Python libraries:

- `tkinter` (comes with Python standard library)
- `pyautogui`
- `pynput`
- `Pillow` (for image drawing and system tray icon)
- `pystray`
  
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. **Set Times**: Enter the start time (required) and an optional end time in the format `HH:MM` (24-hour clock).
2. **Change Mouse Coordinates**: To change the coordinates where the mouse will move, click the "Change Coordinate" button and double-click anywhere on your screen. The new coordinates will be saved to your desktop.
3. **System Tray**: The application can be minimized to the system tray. You can reopen the app or quit it from the tray icon menu.

## How It Works

- The program listens for mouse clicks and saves the coordinates of the click to a file on the desktop.
- It monitors the system time and moves the mouse to the saved coordinates at the defined times, simulating a click.
- The user interface allows setting the times and changing the target coordinates through a simple GUI.

## Running the App

To run the application, simply execute the Python script:

```bash
python Main.py
```

Alternatively, you can download the ready-to-use `.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Amirabbasjadidi/Mouse-Mover/releases/) page.
